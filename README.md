# Buttseqs
Button Sequencer Hardware DAW Groovebox
This is the code for a Teensy 4.1 sequencer, drum machine, synth etc. with a lot of buttons.
This needs SdFat-beta-master and a modified version of the Audio Library (that uses SDFat instead of SD) to run (I think I have probably broken the SD functions of the audio library when doing this). 
It is missing the following features: CC editing, pattern saving, control over audio parameters, many QoL features, better pattern management. and much more! A lot of the features need refinement.
